# Models

This folder contains models that are done or require further improvements.

## Purpose

This helps to keep the repository organized and makes it easier for users to find working models.

## Contributing

If you want to contribute to one of these models, feel free. Don't forget to specify what type of contribution you are going to make, to fix a bug, add a new feature or improve the code's architecture. Try to code in the format of the other templates for better work and simplicity in use.



## Disclaimer

If you want to use a model in this folder, don't say you made it unless you contributed to one of the models used. To be recognized for work you didn't do is really sad :(.
